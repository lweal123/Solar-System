Just screwing around with trying to make a (semi) functional solar system diagram.
The orbit times, rotation times, orbit diameters, and planet diameters are not scaled to a consistent ratio.
  - I generally tried to make all ratios and speeds relative to Earth.
  - The challenge was that the sun is so large that creating ratios that would fit on a screen became difficult.
    - If I made the smallest planets more visible (larger), then the sun becomes enormous and takes up most of the page.
  - Orbit diameters could not be kept consistent with planet sizes otherwise the orbits would extend far beyond
  a typical viewing width.
  - Rotation and orbit speeds are not scaled the same, otherwise it would take hours for some of the orbits to occur.

Things I want to continue to add:
  - dwarf planets (gonna be a challenge do to scaling)
  - moons and moon orbits (gonna be a challenge do to scaling)
  - solar flares
  - asteroids (maybe)
  - frequency of typical UFO visits to our system (would need NASA and Area 51 input for this) [jk]
